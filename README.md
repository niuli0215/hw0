# HW 0

I change this file~

* Assigned: January 19th
* Due: January 21st 8:40 AM


The goal of this assignment is to set up a Linux virtual machine and Postgres database running in Microsoft Azure.

Many of the assignments in this class will use Microsoft's cloud computing
infrastructure.  Using a cloud service like Microsoft (or Amazon, etc) makes it easy to
share data, and run any number of virtual machines that are
identical for all students in the class. For this homework, we will use a free
instance, but we will provide educational credits for future assignments.

<span style="color:#ff5511">**Caution: running services (e.g., virtual machines) on any cloud provider
  costs money or credits.  It can be _very_ easy to spend more than you anticipated by leaving your services
  running.  Make it a habit to stop your services when not in use.  If you run out of credits,
  there's not much we (the staff) can do.**</span>


## Sign up and setup the OS

**Signup**

[Register for a free trial account](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0044p/)

You may be asked to submit your credit card information for screening purposes, however _you will not be charged_ as
the service will stop your account if your trial credits are used up.
Once the class registration has settled down, we will provide you with information to use the class's Azure credits.


**Launch an instance**

1. Go to [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Click "Resource groups" in the top left of the screen.
3. Click "Add".
3. Type any name (e.g. "w4111").
4. Change "Resource group location" to "East US".
5. Click Create.
6. Click "+ New" in the top left of the screen.
7. Click "Compute", then select **Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS** under Featured Apps.
8. Click Create (leave "deployment model" at the default: "Resource Manager").
9. Click on "Basics".
10. In "User name" type the name for your account on your own machine, and fill in a password (please use a "good" one).
11. In "Resource group" click the arrow on the right hand side and select the group you created in step 5.
12. Click OK at the bottom.
13. In the "Size" section, choose "A1 Standard" on the right.
14. In the "Settings" section click "OK" at the bottom.
15. In the "Summary" section click "OK". This will display a message that it is creating your machine.
16. After it starts, you will see a number in "Public IP" like 40.76.207.44, this is your machine's address.


**SSH to Your Instance**

Using a terminal program (e.g, MacOS Terminal, or an xterm on Athena, or a Cygwin terminal under windows), type:

    ssh <username>@<IP address>

It will first ask to verify the identity of the server with the following message:

    The authenticity of host 'hellodb.cloudapp.net (168.61.188.128)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 30:6f:12:df:b0:a7:4f:cc:f6:ee:19:a6:11:e5:2a:e9.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

Type "yes" and press enter. You will only need to do this once. It will then ask for your password. After you enter it, you should see something like:

    Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.19.0-25-generic x86_64)

**Install additional software**


Ensure the following packages are available using the Ubuntu package management tool _apt-get_.  

To install a package, type:

    sudo apt-get install <packagename1 packagename2 ...>

Use this command to install the following packages:

* postgresql-9.3
* postgresql-server-dev-9.3
* sqlite3
* git
* python-virtualenv
* python-dev



**Setup Python**: 

Python uses its own package manager to install/update/remove packages.  In general, the following installs python packages:

    pip install <packagename>
    
Typically the package manager will require `sudo` and install the packages in a global folder that affects everyone using your machine.  This is bad hygiene because different python applications may use different versions of packages and it's easy to step on each other's toes.  

We will use `virtualenv` to create virtual environments that contain their own copies of `python` and packages.  When we work in a virtual environment, pip will install packages local to the environment rather than globbaly.  You can read [a detailed tutorial](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/). We installed the `virtualenv` command with apt-get above.
    
Lets setup your environment

1. Install some helper commands from the `virtualenvwrapper` package (this is the one time you should install globally)

        sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
2. add the wrapper commands (you may add this line in `~/.bashrc` so it runs when you create a bash shell)

        source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
3. create a new environment (will create a folder `test/` in `~/.virtualenvs/`)

        mkvirtualenv test
4. switch (activate) an environment by using `workon`

        workon test
        
5. switch out of an environment:
        
        deactivate


Now let's install a set of useful packages into your environment:
   
1. Activate your environment (see above)
2. install the following packages using `pip` (see above)
    * flask
    * psycopg2
    * sqlalchemy
    * click
3. Deactivate and you're done
      
  

**Sign up for GitHub**

GitHub is a source control repository website that many in industry use to manage their projects.
In fact, this class is organized as repositories under the organization 4111: http://www.github.com/w4111.  
Each assignment is managed as a separate repository. 
As the course progresses, more repositories will be made available.

**Checkout the homework 0 repository**

To work on an assignment, it's a good idea to "fork" the repository into your own
GitHub account and complete the assignment there.  Let's try this with the homework
0 repository at https://github.com/w4111/hw0

1. To start, [fork the repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
1. [Clone](http://gitref.org/creating/#clone) the repository to your Azure VM
1. Once you modify your files, [commit](http://gitref.org/basic/#commit) the changes.
1. If you want to share it with a teammate, or just want to make sure GitHub has a copy of your files in case
   the VM crashes, [Push](http://gitref.org/remotes/#push) the changes to GitHub.
1. If your teammate pushed to the same repository on GitHub, pull the changes from GitHub by typing within the repository:

        git pull


## Test that things worked

Let's make sure you have access to Python, sqlite3, and the git repository.

**Python**

Type `python` and ensure that you see the following like (the Python version may be slightly different 2.7.X):

    Python 2.7.4 (default, Apr 19 2013, 18:28:01) 
    [GCC 4.7.3] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 

Then try importing some modules from the packages we installed

    >>> import flask
    >>> import psycopg2
    >>> import sqlalchemy
    >>> import click

If that worked, push `ctrl+d` to exit the prompt.

**sqlite3**

SQLite is an "embedded" SQL database (it doesn't depend on a dedicated server process;  instead the client just manipulated a stored
datbase file directly.)

To ensure it is installed, type `sqlite3` and verify that you see the following:

    SQLite version 3.7.15.2 2013-01-09 11:53:05
    Enter ".help" for instructions
    Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
    sqlite>

If you do, press `CTRL-D` to exit the prompt (or type `.quit`).


**PostgreSQL**

We will use the PostgreSQL DBMS in this class.  Check that the client program works:

    psql --version

If it prints something like the following then it works
   
    psql (PostgreSQL) 9.3.9
    

**git repository**

Type `cat hw0/README.md` 

You should see the instructions for this hw fly by.



## Perform some data analysis

To complete this homework, go into your `hw0/` directory.  There should be a file called
`iowa-liquor-sample.csv`.  The state of Iowa [released](https://data.iowa.gov/Economy/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy)
a dataset containing all sales transactions at alcoholic beverage stores during 2014.    We will use
this dataset for many assignments in this course.  Since it contains over 3 million records, this is
a small sample.

**Disclaimer: this course does not condone drinking, we are using this dataset because it is a common format
  for a sales transaction log in a silghtly more accessible domain than typical bank transactions**

Write a python script that reads the file and computes the number of records 
(in this file, each line is a record) that contain the exact case insensitive phrase "single malt scotch".
Ignore upper and lower casing, so "Single Malt Scotch", and "SINGLE Malt Scotch" all match, whereas
"Single's Malty Scootch" does not.



## Submitting your work

Submit your assignment at http://goo.gl/forms/SQzmn4T4xd

**Note that you must be logged in to Columbia's lionmail to submit, and we will only consider your _first_ submission**.


Whew, you're almost done!  Go read the assigned readings.

## Stop your virtual machine

While your free trial is pretty good,  it's very easy to accidentally use up all of your credits (including those the course will provide you).
To conserve your hours (and avoid wasting energy), make sure to turn off your machine **whenever you are not using it**. 

1. Go to the [Azure Console](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. In the left panel, click on "Virtual Machines".
3. Select your VM.
4. Click "Stop" in the menu at the top of the screen, then click "Yes".
5. To resume the VM,  click "Start" in the menu.
6. Before doing future assignments, you'll have to follow these instructions and choose "Start" to restart your instance.  Note that Shutting down and Starting the instance will potentially change the "Public DNS" value for that instance, however the URL <name>.cloudapp.net will stay the same.

*NOTE*: Turning off your machine from the command prompt does not work on Azure (this seems to be "by design" which seems ... strange).
